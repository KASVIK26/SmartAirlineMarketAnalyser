Test Task: Build a Python Web App for Airline Booking Market Demand Data
We are a group of hostels located across multiple cities in Australia, and we want to gather and analyze market demand trends in the airline booking industry. Your task is to develop a web app that fetches market demand data for airline bookings, processes it, and displays insights via a user-friendly interface.
This task will help us understand how well you can handle real-world challenges. If you do well, there’s great potential for a full-time position with us.
Key Features of the Web App
1. Data Scraping: The web app should scrape publicly available data on airline bookings or use open, free APIs related to travel or airline industry data.
2. API Integration: Integrate the app with an API (such as ChatGPT or any other relevant free API) to process the data and extract insights like demand trends, pricing changes, and popular routes.
3. Web App Interface: Create a simple, intuitive web interface where users can:
* Input filters or view results
* Visualize trends using charts or tables
4. Data Processing: Clean and process the data to provide actionable insights, including:
* Popular routes
* Price trends
* High-demand periods or locations
5. Output: The processed data should be displayed in a user-friendly, visual format for easy understanding.
Evaluation Criteria
* Functionality of the web app
* Clarity and relevance of the insights generated
* Code quality and documentation
* Problem-solving approach
* User experience and ease of use
Timeline
We are expecting this task to be completed within 1 day of assignment, as we are looking for fast results with minimal spending using available free tools.
Future Use
This tool could become a long-term asset for us to monitor market demand trends. We want to build it as a web app so it’s easy for our team to use without requiring coding knowledge.
